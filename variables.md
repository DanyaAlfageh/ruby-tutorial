# Variables

## What is a variable?
- A variable as a word used to store a value (information) in programs.
- To assign a value to a variable, use '=' operator.
The name of variable in the left and value of this variable in the right.

## Examples:
```ruby
welcome = 'Welcome to Ruby Programming'
one     = 1
price   = 10.25
```

In above examples, welcome, one and price are variables. In there:
- welcome has value is 'Welcome to Ruby Programming'
- one has value is 1 
- price has value is 10.25


Now we can reference to variables like that:
```ruby
irb:001> welcome
=> "Welcome to Ruby Programming"
irb:002> price
=> 10.25
```

## Try others example in irb:

```ruby
# string
hello = "Hello World!"

# number
money = 1000
price = 100.25

# booleans
true_val  = true
false_val = false  
```
